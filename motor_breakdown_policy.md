We will take payment at the point when you notify us that you require our services. If we take payment and arrange assistance at your request and you subsequently cancel the call-out, but we have already dispatched one of our recovery operators, we will not refund the excess money you have paid. If your vehicle then has another breakdown and you call us for assistance, you will be charged the excess amount for this second breakdown and any further callouts thereafter. 
2. The vehicle must be permanently registered in the UK and, if appropriate, have a current MOT certificate and valid road fund license or tax disc on display. The vehicle should be kept in a good condition and have been serviced regularly in line with the manufacturer’s recommendations. It must be less than 16 years old since first registration.


3. You will have to pay the cost of moving the vehicle or a repair vehicle coming out to you if, after asking for help which you are entitled to, the vehicle is moved or repaired in any other way, or you have provided location details which are incorrect. The payment must be by credit or debit card. 

4. The vehicle must carry a serviceable spare tyre and wheel for the vehicle. This condition does not apply if the vehicle is not designed to carry a spare wheel. If the vehicle is not designed to carry a spare wheel, you will need to carry the appropriate aerosol repair kit.
